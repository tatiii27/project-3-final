        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This interactive bubble chart explores skincare products by brand. Bubble size encodes price,
          color encodes rating, and bubbles are positioned along a price axis. Use the controls to filter
          by category, skin type, and price.

        <h2>Compelling Question</h2>
        <p>
          How do skincare product <strong>price</strong>, <strong>consumer rating</strong>, and
          <strong>skin-type suitability</strong> interact across brands and categories—and do higher prices reliably
          correlate with better ratings?

        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>

        <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
        <p>
          We chose a clustered bubble chart because circular marks effectively convey multiple quantitative
          attributes while supporting rapid comparison. Each bubble represents a single skincare product.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Position (x-axis):</strong> Product price, mapped linearly left to right, emphasizes affordability versus luxury tiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Size (radius):</strong> Encodes relative price magnitude to reinforce the cost dimension visually without requiring axis reference.</li>
          <li><strong>Color (fill):</strong> Encodes average consumer rating using a perceptually ordered diverging red–yellow–green scale; the scale re-computes per filter state to keep contrast meaningful.</li>
          <li><strong>Text (label):</strong> Brand name centered in the bubble for quick identification.</li>
          <li><strong>Tooltip:</strong> Full product name, category, exact price, rating, and supported skin types.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interaction Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dropdown Filters:</strong> Filter by product category and skin type.</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Price Range:</strong> Slider limits visible products by max price.</li>
          <li><strong>Animated Re-layout:</strong> Force simulation reclusters after filter updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Hover Details & Highlight:</strong> Tooltip plus a clear focus outline.</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent Highlight:</strong> The two brands that are being compared are highlighted in pink.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Legend:</strong> Legend reflects the subset’s rating range.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
        <p>
          Raw CSV fields (<code>Label</code>, <code>brand</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>price</code>, 
          <code>rank</code>, and binary skin-type columns) were parsed numerically. Only filtering and ranking are applied:
          within each filter state, the top 20 highest-rated products are shown to maintain readability.
          The color scale recalculates the minimum and maximum <code>rank</code> values in each subset so that relative
          rating variation remains visible. Data annotations were added to map skin-type suitability from binary columns
          into a single array for tooltip display. The well known active ingredients were found in each of the products that are shown,
          which also helped determine how many brands/products to show.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>This project was completed collaboratively over roughly <strong>30 person-hours</strong> of development.</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Phase</th><th>Tasks</th><th>Approx. Hours</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Exploratory Analysis</td><td>Inspect dataset, identify question, test static plots</td><td>5 h</td></tr>
            <tr><td>D3 Structure Setup</td><td>Load data, scales, force simulation</td><td>7 h</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Interaction Logic</td><td>Dropdowns, slider, legend, axis arrow</td><td>6 h</td></tr>

        <p>
          A data set was chosen as a collective and our group discussed potential directions for analysis and visuals. 
          Group members each made 2 visuals for the project check point independently of one another. After assessing each others' work,
          a choice was made to use one visual and encorporate elements in that visual that we all liked from each others work. Group members 
          worked crossfunctionally to edit the repository with Git by adding new functionality to the bubble chart, further refine visual 
          encodings and explore user-experience. A member did the write up and other members added and detracted to leave us with this final submission.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection and Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Our final design balances exploratory flexibility with clarity. By limiting to three quantitative dimensions, we
          maintained readability and visual balance. The blue hover cue and dynamic color legend enhance usability, while
          smooth transitions preserve spatial context. Filters and details-on-demand encourage exploration of meaningful
          sub-patterns, such as affordable yet highly rated options for specific skin types. The most time-intensive part involved 
          tuning force-layout physics (collision radius, horizontal clustering)
          and ensuring hover transitions did not interfere with label layering. Debugging and dynamic color updates
          required several iterative adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, this interactive visualization provides an engaging, data-driven view of how price and satisfaction
          interact across the skincare market, helping users identify which products deliver the best value for
          their skin type. We considered alternatives such as scatterplots, bar-plots and small-multiples faceted by skin type, but these created
          either overplotting, fragmented comparisons or lacked visual intrigue. The bubble layout offered the clearest synthesis of brand
          identity and quantitative comparison while remaining visually engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, working together was an awesome experience! Our team really worked in unison to develop something we were all equally proud of. 
          During our collaboration there were several moments where ideas were bounced around and we all contributed to the final product, 
          highlighting how this project was truly a team effort. We spent over 3 sessions working together on zoom and several more hours working 
          independently to contribute to the final product.
